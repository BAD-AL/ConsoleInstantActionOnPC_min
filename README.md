# Console Instant Action screen on PC
Addon to support console instant action screen on PC.

This Addon will hijack the 'space training' button on the 'Single Player' menu screen to launch the Console style mission select screen.
Using the Mouse to click around doesn't work great. The interface was designed to work with the directional, back, accept keys/buttons.

It comes in folder '000' but folder name doesn't matter, you should be able to change it to whatever you want.

The Instant Action Screen supports the following keys:
|-----------------------------|
|    Up, Down, Left, Right    |
|    W,  S,    A,    D        |
|    Page Up (LTrigger)       |
|    Page Down (RTrigger)     |
|    Space, Enter (accept)    |
|    Escape (back)            |
